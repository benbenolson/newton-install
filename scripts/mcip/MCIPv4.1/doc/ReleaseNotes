********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 4.1 (11 May 2012)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code is updated to version 4.1.  These release notes and the change
log reflect all changes that have been made to MCIP since MCIPv4.0 (the last
official release).  Changes to MCIPv4.1 were made by Tanya Otte (U.S. EPA).
User contributions are also noted below.  The detailed list of changes to the
MCIP code is in the CHANGES file, which is part of the MCIP tar file in the
"doc" sub-directory.

MCIPv4.1 requires an upgrade to I/O API version 3.1 to support error-checking
within the I/O API.  This is consistent with the requirement for I/O API v3.1
with CMAQv5.0.1 (released concurrently with MCIPv4.1).

MCIPv4.1 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

Users are encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file,
which is located in the MCIP tar file in the "doc" sub-directory.

***Users should consult the FAQ before submitting inquiries to M3User,
   CMAS, or the code developers.***

The following is a summary of the changes in MCIPv4.1:

 1.  Updated code and made minor corrections to handle spectral nudging
     runs from WRF.

 2.  Force 2-m water vapor mixing ratio from WRF with YSU PBL to be filled
     with layer 1 QVAPOR to avoid occasional Q2 < 0 in wintertime.

 3.  Corrected error in tipping bucket precipitation calculation for long
     WRF runs.

 4.  Added provision for calculating Monin-Obukhov length when the sensible
     heat flux is 0.

 5.  Updated metadata for new physics options in WRFv3.4.
